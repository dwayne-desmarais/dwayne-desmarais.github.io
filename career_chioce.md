# Career Choice
[Home](/index.md)

When I first started this degree, I wasnâ€™t sure what I wanted to do beyond something with computer 
programming.  I am still not certain what I wish to do but I have narrowed down my search considerably.  
There are a number of things I was introduced to during my degree that have caught my eye.  I always 
thought I would pursue a career in game development since I did that for a hobby for many years and 
believed I was quite good at it.  In my research, I found that the job market for this career choice 
is saturated and competition is extremely fierce.  

This led me to explore other options and during other classes I became aware of things like IoT and 
embedded devices, both of these were related to another field that interested me, robotics.  I did 
not decide to pursue robotics specifically though.  I chose to focus on software development instead.  
I noticed a trend in my career choices so far and found that data analysis was a common occurrence for 
me.  I do not care for the statistical aspects of data science but I do enjoy creating the scripts to
collect data and other scripting.  I enjoy programming with C++ and Python the most and found that
Python is a perfect scripting language.  Python also introduced me to embedded devices and exploring
a Raspberry Pi device.  

I still do not have a clear goal for what I want to do but I have narrowed my focus to specific 
languages that I would like to develop into stronger skill sets and begun to look towards job markets
that deal with data manipulation and/or embedded device coding as my direction for my career.

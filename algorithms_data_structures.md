# Algorithms & Data Structures

[Home](/index.md)

## Project Summary

The program I chose for Algorithms and Data Structures is the same program I chose for databases.  
The algorithm and data structure update I planned for this entails a search function so I decided 
to swap week 4-2 and 5-2 and incorporate the new employee database portion into the Zoo Program 
first.  I made this choice based on the fact that coding a search function for two databases and 
adding a third database after the fact would be less efficient programming wise.  

The additional database for employees should be completed before creating a search algorithm for 
the database system.  I am creating the database for the employees similar to the Animal and 
Habitat database structure with similar menu system updates and the standard CRUD management 
options for the database.  After this database is added, I will begin the work on the search 
algorithm for each of the databases.

_Note: This project was used during revisions for both adding a new Database and for adding a search
function for the databases in question.  The search function was used to loop through the database
and create a menu system for selecting which data point to view details on.  (Animal, Employee, or
Habitat)_

_Note: This is the project before adding the Employee database, but containing the basic looping
search function to create menu systems._

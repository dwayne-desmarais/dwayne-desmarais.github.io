# Computer Science Trends
[Home](/index.md)

The first trend I researched was about standardizing the web.  The trend shows that the web is 
becoming more standardized and goes on to discuss OpenAPI and other API standards.  This trend 
will greatly improve the ability to integrate different programs and resources more easily.  The
result of this is a better, more enhanced user experience.  As this trend develops and API 
systems continue to improve, software integrations will become easier and begin to be utilized 
more frequently in programs.  My current employer deals with lots of app integrations into our 
app UI program and standardizing APIs will improve this dramatically.

As for my career choice, I support customers now that utilize APIs from all over the web.  These 
APIs currently have very different conditions and even the syntax can be dramatically different.  
Having a standardized approach would allow programming to be used across multiple APIs to return 
data and manage data from multiple sources.  The programming involved would potentially be reduced 
for handling these different APIs creating a better user experience.

The second trend I reviewed dealt with the rise in cybersecurity and the demand for cybersecurity 
expertise.  This reminds me of the tradesmen shortages, like plumbers and electricians.  In this 
scenario, it is part of the programming and software world, but a very similar impact of a lack of 
cybersecurity experts.  I believe that as this field grows and the demand grows for cybersecurity, 
it will directly impact software programmers and there may be a shift in how programs are designed 
from the start.  Programs will likely be expected to include much more initial security measures in 
the development process.  This will impact my career regardless of what sort of programming I decide 
to focus on as I will need to consider cybersecurity measures more and more as the field grows and 
expands.  I noted that another heavy trend is moving to cloud based computing, which will demand 
even more strict security measures to be taken with programming in the future.

# Database Project

## Project Summary
The decision to add the database prior to creating the search feature was a good learning 
experience within the development of these added features.  Having all the databases created 
first, made designing and testing the search feature easier.  It is important to consider 
all the improvements being made to a program prior to beginning the programming for any 
specific component.  Planning out which ones would be most beneficial to work on first is a 
key part of program design and division of work across multiple teams.

The only issue I encountered was an oversight on the menu system, I utilized (E) for both 
Employee and Exit which initially caused some issues until I recognized and modified 
Employee to use (m) instead.  From then on, the issues were minimal with the construction 
of the database.  The search feature proved to be rather simple with such a small database 
system.  There was no need to use a binary search since the databases only included a 
handful of animals, employees, and habitats.  This made the program simpler, but one thing 
to consider is whether it could be expanded, in this situation, even adding multiple 
locations would not cause a performance issue, a computer system can easily search through 
hundreds of database entries without an issue, even using a looping system.  Beyond this, 
a better search feature that is quicker at searching through records would be needed.

	    My name is Dwayne Desmarais and I have been working with computers since 
	I was 10 years old. My interest in this field came from my love of video games
	when I was young.  I began my studies in high school programming my TI-83 calculator
	with games and a Q-Basic class (GOTO commands for the win!).  I obtained an Associates
	degree in the software programming field in my early 20’s and by that time I had been
	programming as a hobby for over 7 years.  I was self taught in a derivative of the C
	language in my teen years and continued my studies of Visual Basic, Java, C++, Python,
	MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Google Scripting throughout my studies and working
	career.

	This ePortfolio showcases some of my latest projects that I have worked on throughout
	my four year degree.  I have extensive knowledge working with databases and scripting
	languages both in school and in my career.  The majority of my career has been on the
	front lines, handling customer inquiries in a variety of technical settings.

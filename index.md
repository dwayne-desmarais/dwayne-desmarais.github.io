	    My name is Dwayne Desmarais and I have been working with computers 
	since I was 10 years old. My interest in this field came from my love
	of video games when I was young.  I began my studies in high school
	programming my TI-83 calculator with games and a Q-Basic class (GOTO
	commands for the win!).  I obtained an Associates degree in the software
	programming field in my early 20â€™s and by that time I had been program-
	-ming as a hobby for over 7 years.  I was self taught in a derivative of
	the C language in my teen years and continued my studies of Visual Basic,
	Java, C++, Python, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Google Scripting
	throughout my studies and working career.

	This ePortfolio showcases some of my latest projects that I have worked
	on throughout my four year degree.  I have extensive knowledge working
	with databases and scripting languages both in school and in my career. 
	The majority of my career has been on the front lines, handling customer
	inquiries in a variety of technical settings.

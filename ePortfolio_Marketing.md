Creating an ePortfolio as a means of promoting myself in the job market is an excellent first step in 
showing some of my skill sets. Employers in many fields ask for demonstrations of your abilities,
particularly within the software development market. Having a readily available portfolio of some of
your past work is a great way to present yourself with examples that a potential employer can review.  
An ePortfolio combined with a well made resume can be a powerful combination that elevates you above 
others seeking similar jobs in the market.

The major risks for showcasing some of your work is that it may be taken and used by others if it is
made public.  One way to mitigate this is to create snippets of code that demonstrate abilities but 
are not complete projects.  Another easy way to mitigate this is to simply use items that are common-
-place and/or readily available solutions to situations, yet show your unique problem solving skill 
sets.  Lastly, providing completed projects that you are not concerned with releasing to the public 
is another method of mitigating risk.  If these are not options, you can also provide password 
protected items and/or only offer the ePortfolio upon request for certain jobs.  The ePortfolio is 
probably not the best place for something extensive or potential lifesâ€™ work type of projects, so 
keeping the content minimal, but valid is the best practice.
